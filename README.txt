Der er lidt af det hele herinde, men det relevante er mine exercises under "exercises",
mine homeworks under "homeworks", og så mit eksamensprojekt under "exam_project". Yderligere 
har "matlib" også et dokument hvor vektorer og matricer introduceres, og der er sågar også
komplekse tal.

Min README.txt i min mappe med eksamensprojektet kommer vist ikke med over i GITHUB? Så har
inkluderet den her i bunden i det tilfælde.

README for exam:

I deem this exam project about 8 out of 10 points. 

I could have went through some of the other global optimization techniques, but they were not 
requested so they would not have been suited as an answer. Looking at the exam description I am not 
sure what else I could have added. As it stands right now, it does exactly as requested.

As for the split, I am guessing A would be any kind of search with random numbers, and B would then
require the usage of a low-discrepancy sequence. As for C, I am not sure what it would entail.

Regarding the halton low-discrepancy sequence, I have made a function that computes the first N
prime numbers, such that I can solve the problem in any dimension, and so that I avoid having to
carry around an excessively big list of numbers to use as my basis set. The code to write that
function was partially inspired from the internet, although many different functions to find primes
have already been made everywhere.
