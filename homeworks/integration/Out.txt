The integrator is made, and will now be tested on various integrals.
The value of the integral of Sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 is 0.666953909054655, with 13 integrals calculated,
exact solution being 2/3 and using delta = 0.001
Is it within delta? True 

Next integral is 1/Sqrt(x) from 0 to 1. There is a singularity at 0, so
to calculate it I adjust the total accuracy to be less strict, delta = 0.01
The value of the integral of 1/Sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 is 1.9995161175042 with 577273 integrals calculated,
exact solution being 2 and using delta=0.01
Is it within delta? True 

The value of the integral of 4*Sqrt(1-x^2) from 0 to 1 is 3.14183457802727 with 30 integrals calculated,
exact solution being 3.14159265358979 and using delta=0.001
Is it within delta? True 

Now to look at the error function. The plot of it can be seen on erf.svg
The Clenshaw is added as a small modification to the input values before the regular integrator is called.
The value of the integral of 1/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 with Clenshaw is 1.99999201046432 with 12 integrals
calculated, and with an exact result of 2.
So using Clenshaw we had to calculate 12 integrals as compared to 577273!
