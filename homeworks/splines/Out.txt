The first set of x and y values I work with are ones I gave on my Makefile.
I used: x[0]: 1 and y[0]: 2
I used: x[1]: 2 and y[1]: 6
I used: x[2]: 3 and y[2]: 2
I used: x[3]: 4 and y[3]: 1
I used: x[4]: 5 and y[4]: 5
I used: x[5]: 6 and y[5]: 7
I used: x[6]: 7 and y[6]: 8
The plot of this can be seen on lspline.svg together with the quadratic spline from b)
The integral of the linear spline from 1 to 6.5 is 22.125
Now I start on the qspline, which I have made as a class. The plot of the qspline on
the same points as my linear spline can be seen on lspline.svg
I also want to test it on the x-y tables given on the homework-page. The result can
be seen on qspline_test.svg
