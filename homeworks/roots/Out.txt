First I try to find the solution to 1-x^2, which is a simple 1d equation.
One solution to 1-x^2 is:         1 
The other solution is:        -1 
And these are exactly the two solutions we already know.

I now try to find the extrenums to the rosenbrock valley function. I do this by looking
at the roots of the gradient
Solution to rosenbrock with guess (2,2) is=         1      0.999 
f(x_sol)= -0.000358   0.000179 

 This is also equal to the global minimum. No matter what else my starting-guess
is, this is the only root I get.
